CIS 40 - Class exercise 4 solution

1. Consider this Python statement:   print("hello world")
   What is the name of the function?
	print
   What is the input to the function? What data type is the input? How many input?
	input:  "hello world"
	type: a string
	number of input: 1
   Is there an output that is saved in a variable?
	No output going to a variable since there is no = operator

2. Consider this Python statement:    root = findRoot(25.0, 2, .001)
   Is this a function call or a function definition?
	function call
   What is the name of the function?
	findRoot
   What is the input to the function? What data type is the input? How many input?
	input: 25.0, 2, .0013
	type: 1 float, 1 int, 1 float
	number of input: 3
   Is there an output that is saved in a variable?
	the output is saved into a variable called root 
 
3. Write a Python statement that creates a string: "15 / 3 = 5"  where the 5 is calculated
   by the computer.
	>>> outputStr = "15 / 3 = " + str(int(15/3))

4. Write a Python statement that prints the result of 125/8 to 3 digits after the decimal point.
	>>> round(125/8, 3)

5. Write a Python statement that prints the number of characters in the string
   "Python programming class"
	>>> len("Python programming class")

6. Write a script that has:
    - a function definition, maxAndMin, that asks the user for 3 numbers
       and prints the minimum and maximum numbers
	
    - code to call the function maxAndMin

    - a function definition, calcProduct, that accepts 2 numbers as input 
      and returns the product of the 3 numbers

    - code to set 2 variables to 5 and 8
    - code to call the function calcProduct and passes to it the 2 variables, and then prints the product
