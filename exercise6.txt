CIS 40 - Class exercise 6

At the shell:
1. Create variables num1 to store 5, and variable num2 to store -3

2. Write a Python boolean expression that returns True if num1 is less than or equal to num2

3. Write a Python boolean expression that returns True if num2 is a negative number

4. Write a Python boolean expression that returns True if both num1 and num2 are positive

5. Write a Python boolean expression that returns True if either num1 or num2 is positive


In a script:
1. Download the exercise6.py file. This is the same file as exercise5Solution.py but
   without the driver code.

2. Write a Python function called getRadius that:
   - prompts the user for a radius of a circle and reads in the radius
   - prints an error message if the radius is not between 1 and 150, inclusive
   - returns: the radius if the radius is between 1 and 150 inclusive
              -1 if the radius is outside this range
   
3. Write driver code to:
   - call the getRadius() function
   - check the return value of getRadius() and if it's valid,
       - call drawCircle() with a radius that the user specifies and a color of your choice

4. Write a Python function called getColor that:
   - prompts the user for a color of red, green, or blue
   - prints an error message if the color is not valid (not 1 of the 3 above)
   - returns: the color if it's a valid choice
              "unknown" if the color is not valid

5. Add to the driver code so that it does the following:
   - call the getRadius() function
   - check the return value of getRadius() and if the radius is valid,
      	- call the getColor() function
     	- check the return value of getColor() and if the color is valid,
   	  	- draw a circle with a radius and color that the user specifies 
      	- if the color is not valid,
          	- print an error message
   - if the radius is not valid
      	- print an error message
