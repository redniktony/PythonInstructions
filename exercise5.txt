CIS 40 - Class exercise 5

In a script:
1. Write a Python function called drawCircle that:
   - accepts 3 arguments: a turtle object, a radius, and a color (a string)
   - uses the turtle to draw a circle with the specified radius and in the specified color

1a. Write test code to go to the first quadrant and draw a blue circle of size 50

2. Write a Python function called fillCircle that:
   - accepts 4 arguments: a turtle object, a radius, a border color, and a fill color 
   - uses the turtle to draw and fill a circle with the specified radius and colors
     make the pen size larger for the circle border so it's easy to see the border
   - this function must call the drawCircle function to draw the circle.
     Don't copy code above to draw the circle.

2b. Write test code to go to the fourth quadrant and draw a green circle
    with a purple border with size 80

3. Write a Python function called drawTriangle that:
   - accepts 3 arguments:  a turtle object, a side length, and a color
   - uses the turtle to draw the equilateral triangle (all sides are the same) 
     with sides of the specified length and in the specified color
 
3a. Write test code to set the turtle to the original position and draw 
    a red triangle of size 20
