CIS 40 - Class exercise 3

### Note: all answers that start with >>>   means that the statement is
### entered at the shell prompt

1. Write a Python statement to print how many hours there are in a year.
    >>> 24 * 365

2. Write a Python statement that prints the quotient of 20 divided by 3.
    Write a Python statement that prints the remainder of 20 divided by 3.
    >>> 20 / 3               ## note that the result is a float (only for division)
   
    We tried in class:
    >>> 4 / 2                 ## result is 2.0

    >>> 20 % 3              ## use % to get remainder

3. Give an example of an int, float, and str data
    int:  5
    float:  3.14
    str: "hello"

4. Write a Python instruction to assign 4 to the variable called "num1"
   Write a Python instruction to assign 8.2 in a variable called "num2"
   >>> num1 = 4
   >>> num2 = 8.2

   Show the data type of the variable num2.
   >>> type(num2)

   Add the data in the 2 variables and print the sum, with a text explanation
   such as:  The sum of 4 and 8.2 is 12.2
   >>> print ("The sum of", num1 , "and", num2, "is", num1 + num2)

   ## print can accept a list of items to print.
   ## In the case above, the list is made up of:
   ##   string, variable, string, variable, expression

   ## Also note that if we had written the print statement as:
   >>> print ("The sum of num1 and num2 is num1 + num2")  
   ## Then we would just get a text string as an output:
             The sum of num1 and num2 is num1 + num2
   ## To get Python to tell the CPU to fetch the data in a variable 
   ## to print, the variable name needs to be outside of the quotes.
   ##  Likewise, to get Python to tell the CPU to add num1 and num2,
   ##  the expression  num1+num2  has to be outside of the quotes.


5. Write a Python statement that prints 25 of the word "CIS" across the screen.
   >>> "CIS" * 25

6. Write a Python script that asks the user for 2 names, prompt for 1 name at a time.
    Then print the names with a & in between.  
    Example: Barnes & Noble    or    Jack & Jill

   script:

# This script asks the user for 2 names and prints them with & in between

n1 = input("Enter first name: ")
n2 = input("Enter second name: ")
print(n1, "&", n2)


7. Write a script that works as a currency converter for dollar to / from 
   <your choice of currency>
   - print a welcome message to explain what the script does
   - prompt the user and read in the dollar amount
   - print the equivalence in <your choice of currency>
   - prompt the user and read in <your choice of currency> amount
   - print the dollar equivalence

    script:

# This script converts dollars from/to euros

# 1. convert from dollars to euros
dollars = float(input("Enter dollar amount: "))
      ## note that we needd to convert the user input into a float

euro = dollars * 0.95
print(dollars, "dollars =", euro, "euros")

# 2. convert from euros to dollars
euros= float(input("Enter euro amount: "))
     ## same here, convert the user input into a float

dollars = euros / 0.95
print(euros, "euros =", dollars, "dollars")
