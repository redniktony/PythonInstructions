CIS 40 - Class exercise 10

In a script, creat a Circle class with the following attributes:
  - size
  - x, y location
  - color
  - a turtle object
and the following methods:
  __init__, which accepts a size as input, and initializes all attributes
 
  __str__, which returns a string "color circle"  where color is the color 
      	of the circle

  draw, which draws a circle with the size, color attributes
        and at the x,y location attribute

  fill, which accepts a turtle object, and draws a circle just like the draw
	method, but the circle is filled

  setPosition, which accepts the x,y coordinate and sets them as object attributes

  setColor, which accepts a color and sets it as the object attribute


Write the driver code to:
- create a Circle object with size 40
- set the object's position to 50, 50
- set the object's color to red
- draw a filled circle
- print the object description

- set the object's position to 0,0
- set the object's color to blue
- draw an unfilled circle
